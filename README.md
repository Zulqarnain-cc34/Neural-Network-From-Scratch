### Overview

🎉 Welcome to this amazing tutorial series on neural networks! 🧠
We'll guide you through the fascinating journey of understanding and implementing these powerful tools. 🚀
Let's dive into each chapter:

#### Chapter 1: Simple Predictor: 💡
Discover how computers are simple predicting machines without thinking!
We'll show you how to implement this concept with a fun example. 🖥️

#### Chapter 2: Classifier is not so different from Predictor 🔄
We'll explore how a simple predictor can transform into a classifier,
and illustrate this with a captivating example. 🎯

#### Chapter 3: Learning Rate 🏃‍♂️
Uncover the magic of the learning rate and how it helps to moderate our updates in the learning process. ⚖️

#### Chapter 4: Sometimes One Classifier is not Enough 🧩
Learn why one classifier might not be enough and unravel the mystery of the XOR example. ❌

#### Chapter 5: Neuron and Activation Function 🧪
Get an up-close look at the structure of a neuron and how the activation function plays a vital role in neural networks. 🔬

#### Chapter 6: Modeling an Artificial Neural Network 🎨
Master the art of modeling an artificial structure of the brain with neurons, creating your own neural masterpiece! 🌟

#### Chapter 7: Understanding Neural Networks 🕵️‍♂️
Peek inside the inner workings of neural networks, modeled after our very own brains. 🧠

#### Chapter 8: Matrix Multiplication is useful 📐
Unlock the power of matrices, making calculations in neural networks a breeze.
We'll demonstrate this with a 2-input, 2-layer neural network example. 🧮

#### Chapter 9: BackPropagation 🌊
Dive into the world of backpropagation and learn how it works in neural networks. 💫

Get ready to embark on this exciting adventure, as we take you from the basics of neural networks to implementing your very own machine learning library! 🤖🌟
