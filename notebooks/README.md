### Chapter 1: Simple Predictor:
Talks about how comoputers are simple predicting machines without thinking but we can implement it and shows it using an example.

### Chapter 2: Classifier is not so different from Predictor
Talks about how a simple predictor can be made into a classifier and shows it using an example.

### Chapter 3: Learning Rate
Talks about how a Learning rate works to moderate our updates.

### Chapter 4: Sometimes One Classifier is not Enough
Talks about how a One Classifier might not be enough and shows an example, the XOR example.

### Chapter 5: Neuron and Activation Function
Talks about how a Neuron structure looks like and how it has an activation function.

### Chapter 6: Modeling an Artificial Neural Network
Talks about how a to model an artificial structure of brain, neurons.

### Chapter 7: Understanding Neural Networks
SHows the inner workings of the neural networks which are modeled from the brain.

### Chapter 8: Matrix Multiplication is useful
SHows how matrices makes it easy for us to do calculation in neural networks and shows an example with a 2 input 2 layer neural network.
